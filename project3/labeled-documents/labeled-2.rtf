\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Computer science
\b0  is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computation}} and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(computer_science)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 procedures}} (or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 algorithms}}) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computer scientist}} specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-1"}}{\fldrslt

Its fields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_disciplines"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 practical disciplines}}. Some fields, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computational complexity theory}} (which explores the fundamental properties of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computational}} and intractable problems), are highly abstract, while fields such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_(computer_science)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computer graphics}} emphasize real-world visual applications. Other fields still focus on challenges in implementing computation. For example, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 programming language theory}} considers various approaches to the description of computation, while the study of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computer programming}} itself investigates various aspects of the use of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 programming language}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 complex systems}}. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Human\'96computer interaction}} considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 universally accessible}} to humans.\

\cf2 The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_computer"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 digital computer}}. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 abacus}} have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Further, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 algorithms}} for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.\
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Schickard"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Wilhelm Schickard}} designed and constructed the first working {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 mechanical calculator}} in 1623.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-4"}}{\fldrslt

In 1820, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Xavier_Thomas"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Thomas de Colmar}} launched the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 mechanical calculator}} industry{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-6"}}{\fldrslt

During the 1940s, as new and more powerful {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computing}} machines were developed, the term 
\i computer

\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [11]}} As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 computation}} in general. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-Denning_cs_discipline-14"}}{\fldrslt

\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [14]}} Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.\
Although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study, in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-Levy1984-17"}}{\fldrslt
